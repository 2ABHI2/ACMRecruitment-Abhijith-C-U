SORTING ALGORITHM

I chose Insertion Sort for this program.It works by taking one element at a time and placing it in its correct position among the already sorted elements.

It starts from the second element and compares it with the elements before it.

If the element before is bigger, it shifts it to the right.

This continues until the element finds its correct place.

Then it moves to the next element and repeats the process.
